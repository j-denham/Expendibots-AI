# Expendibots-AI

This project is an attempt to construct an AI that can play the game of Ependibots to a reasonable level, utilising machine learning to an evaluation function coupled with a search over the possible moves that the AI can make.

All code in `Referee/` was written by tutors at The University of Melbourne and **NOT** by me! This code was provided as a driver program for 2 players to play the game, along with providing a bunch of other handy utilities so that students may focus on constructing the player.
